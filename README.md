# Manage EC2 Instances with Pave#

## Usage ##

    bin/pave launch production       # creates an ec2 instance using production config
    bin/pave terminate i-5e09b621    # terminates ec2 instance i-5e09b621
    bin/pave list                    # lists basic info for all ec2 instances 

## Install ##

`cd` to your rails app. Install pave with the following command:

     curl https://raw.github.com/mm53bar/pave/master/install.sh | sh

Now you'll have `bin/pave` in your app folder.

## Config ##

Pave uses Amazon's EC2 API Tools to interact with EC2.  You'll need to make sure that those tools are installed properly and available in your $PATH before Pave will work.  Check out [Setting Up the Amazon EC2 Command Line Tools](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/SettingUp_CommandLine.html) for help with this.

Once that's done, check out your .env.sample file to make sure you fill in the config settings.

### Keypairs ###

I prefer to use my own ssh key rather than an ssh keypair that was generated by Amazon. However, Pave can handle any keypair as long as it is registered with Amazon. For more information on how to register your own ssh key with Amazon, read [Uploading Personal ssh Keys to Amazon EC2](http://alestic.com/2010/10/ec2-ssh-keys).

### Just tell me what to do! ###

Here are the steps that you could follow if you don't want to read the docs I linked above:

    brew install ec2-api-tools

    cat >> ~/.bash_profile <<EOF
    export JAVA_HOME="$(/usr/libexec/java_home)"
    export EC2_HOME="/usr/local/Library/LinkedKegs/ec2-api-tools/jars"
    export EC2_URL=https://ec2.us-east-1.amazonaws.com
    export PATH=$PATH:$EC2_HOME/bin
    export AWS_ACCESS_KEY=my_aws_access_key
    export AWS_SECRET_KEY=my_aws_secret_key
    EOF

    source ~/.bash_profile
    
    keypair=$USER
    publickeyfile=$HOME/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
    regions=$(ec2-describe-regions | cut -f2)

    for region in $regions; do
      echo $region
      ec2-import-keypair --region $region --public-key-file $publickeyfile $keypair
    done
        
    cat >> .env <<EOF
    KEYPAIR=$USER
    INSTANCE_TYPE=m1.small
    REGION=us-east-1
    AMI=ami-9c78c0f5
    EOF

Now just run the launch command to build your first instance!

    bin/pave launch
    
## What's with the .env files? ##

Storing your config settings in an `.env` file is something I first read about in the [12-Factor app docs](http://www.12factor.net/config). Foreman also supports the `.env` files. When I started looking for a place to store config settings, an `.env` file made more sense than something like a Capfile.

I've also pushed this a bit further when it comes to support multi-stage situations. If you are building a server for a staging environment, create an `.env.staging` file in your app with all of your staging settings. For production, create an `env.production` file.

## Choosing an AMI ##

* [Prefer 64-bit instances](http://alestic.com/2012/03/ec2-64-bit)
* [Prefer EBS Boot instances](http://alestic.com/2012/01/ec2-ebs-boot-recommended)
* [My preference - search for "precise 64 us east ebs"](http://cloud.ubuntu.com/ami/)
